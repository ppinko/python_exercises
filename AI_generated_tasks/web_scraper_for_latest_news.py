Web Scraper for Latest News

Write a Python program that scrapes the latest news headlines from a news
website and saves them to a file.

Your Task:

- Extract the latest headlines using BeautifulSoup.
- Save the headlines to a text file (news_headlines.txt).
- Print the headlines to the console in a clean format.

Example Output (news_headlines.txt):
Latest News Headlines:
1. Scientists Discover New Exoplanet with Water
2. Global Markets Show Signs of Recovery
3. AI Revolution: How It’s Changing Everyday Life
4. New Study Links Sleep Patterns to Productivity

Constraints:
✅ Use BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML.
