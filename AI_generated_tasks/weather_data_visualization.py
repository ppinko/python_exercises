Weather Data Visualization

Write a Python program that:
1. Reads temperature data from a CSV file (weather_data.csv).
2. Plots a line chart of daily temperature changes.
3. Adds labels, title, and grid for better readability.
4. Highlights the hottest and coldest days on the graph.

Example Input (weather_data.csv)

Date,Temperature
2024-03-01,12
2024-03-02,15
2024-03-03,10
2024-03-04,18
2024-03-05,20
2024-03-06,14
2024-03-07,22
2024-03-08,19
2024-03-09,25
2024-03-10,21

Expected Plot:
📉 A line graph where:
✅ X-axis = Dates
✅ Y-axis = Temperature
✅ Markers on the hottest & coldest days
✅ A grid and labeled axes

Bonus Challenge:
⭐ Add a moving average trendline to smooth out fluctuations.
⭐ Use different colors for temperature ranges (e.g., blue for cold, red for hot).
⭐ Save the plot as an image file (weather_plot.png).
