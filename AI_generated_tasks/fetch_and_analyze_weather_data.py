Fetch and Analyze Weather Data

Your task is to fetch real-time weather data from an API, process it, and
generate a simple summary report.

Steps:
- Fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API (or any public API of your choice).
- Extract relevant information (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed).
- Process the data (e.g., convert temperatures from Kelvin to Celsius/Fahrenheit).
- Save the processed data to a report file (weather_report.txt).

Example API Request:

You can use OpenWeatherMap’s API (you’ll need a free API key).

Example request to get weather for London:
https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=YOUR_API_KEY

Expected Output (weather_report.txt):
Weather Report for London:
Temperature: 18.5°C
Humidity: 65%
Wind Speed: 3.6 m/s
Condition: Clear Sky

Constraints:
- Use requests or urllib to fetch data.
- Handle network errors gracefully (e.g., invalid API key, no internet).
- Allow the city name to be passed as a command-line argument.

Bonus Challenge:
- Format the report nicely as a table using prettytable.
- Support multiple cities in one request.
- Automatically detect the user's location and fetch weather for it.
